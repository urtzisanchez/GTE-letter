          <p>
            I studied Mechanized Technician degree at the CPES Somorrostro BHIP
            of Muskiz (Bizkaia) from 2008 to 2011 with a grade of 7.3. I did the
            internship in TSM, a Mechanized fabric in Gallarta (bilbao) from
            April 2011 to Junie 2011, my task was; make customized electrical
            tower parts on CNC machines. I learned so much but I did not like
            those sector, so I decided still searching .

          <p>
            From 2014 to 2015 I was living in Mumbai (India) working as a
            fashion model, I returned to Spain and I have took my first
            Programming course, it was where I discovered that it was my
            passion. Being a sector that requires a good level of English and at
            that time I did not know, I went to Edinburgh at the end of 2015, I
            worked for a year at the Edinburgh airport as a Passenger service
            agent. .

          <h3>Aviation experiences from 2016 to 2020</h3>
          <p>
            I returned to Spain in 2016 because I wanted to be close to my
            family, between India and Scotland I had lost the first steps and
            words of my first nephew. I started working in Air Europa offices
            thanks to having been in Scotland, I worked in the DCS desk Handling
            department. I was there until 2018 when I went to work at Wamos Air,
            because my sister Nerea works there and that made me feel closer to
            her. In 2020 the global pandemic arrived and I was kicked out due to
            Covid. I went to Switzerland to work during the pandemic and see if
            I could learn German, since we were in a pandemic the academies were
            closed. I worked at the Toro Bar in Zurich, where I lived, they gave
            me a 5-year work permit, but I was only there for one, I found out
            that aviation was reactivating again and I just wanted to be close
            to my family and friends, and to be honest , all countries are
            beautiful but nothing compare to Spain, I suppose we all think same,
            everyone wants to live in their own country. Upon my return I
            started working in Wamos again but due to the champagne effect that
            has been created in the world, people do not stop traveling,
            therefore neither do I, I am hardly at home, and I do not see my
            family and friends. That made me make a decision. Be close to my
            family as much as I can and Work on what I've always wanted, which
            is Web/App developer. I contacted my old boss, Manuel Franco (I did
            my internship at his company and he loved how I work). I told him
            that I wanted to study Full Stack abroad; The USA, Canada or
            Australia are the best in programming and the ones that have a
            recognition of studies for international students. He told me that
            he is looking for someone with that profile and that since he knows
            me, he would hire me if I obtain the degree

          <h3>What I am doing now?</h3>
          <p>
            Right now I am working at Wamos Air as a Cabin crew, it is the
            second time I have worked for this company, the first time was
            before the global pandemic. It is a job that I really like, I enjoy
            traveling and doing tasks on board, but it is a lonely life and you
            lose important moments in your life with your loved ones, I missed
            my sister's wedding, my nephews' birthdays, Christmas, etc... You
            know many destinations, but it has a very high price, not enjoying
            yours, Spain in my case, and barely seeing my family and friends. I
            have learned a lot in this sector for so long, but it has made me
            realize that I am missing out on the simple and beautiful things in
            life, which is enjoying time with my family, watching my nephews
            grow and one day being able to have and raise a mine.

          <h3>How is the market in Spain?</h3>
          <p>
            Programming in Spain is booming, Malaga the future Silicon Valley of
            Europe. 90% of Europe is looking for programmers in Spain to work
            remotely, I suppose it is cheaper to hire a programmer in Spain than
            in their countries of origin. The salaries of a Junior are around
            €25,000 to €35,000 and a senior more than €50,000 per year, with
            those salaries in Spain you are the King.

          <h3>What will study in Australia bring me?</h3>
          <p>
            Studying in Australia will give me the knowledge and recognition to
            be able to grow in Manuel's company (Best-Marketing) or apply to a
            Spanish or international company. In addition, it should be noted
            that English is the language spoken worldwide, not only English
            people, also to anyone from another country. On the other hand, I
            will also have access to online courses or conferences, or to be
            able to go to another country to attend these courses, which are
            usually taught in English, which will allow me to improve much
            better in my sector. In short, improving this language and learning
            and improving programming knowledges will open many doors for me,
            both at work and at the personal level, allowing many of the
            limitations I have, will not exist. For this reason, I decided to
            study Full stack (Front end and back end web development) in
            Australia.

          <h3>Why study in Australia and not Spain?</h3>
          <p>
            Very simple, USA, Canada, New Zealand and Australia are the top of
            the pyramid for Spain, so a certificate of studies there is worth a
            thousand times more than any certificate in Spain, even though it is
            the same, why? You study it in English, so the company makes sure
            that you are competent in the global market. They understand that
            having someone who has trained with the best can only raise the
            level of the company and the co-workers. Conclusion, if you want to
            be different from 95% of the population, you must do different
            things. The effort of studying for a few years in Australia will be
            my reward and endorsement to form a life and a dignified retirement
            in my country, Spain.

            Future projects and objectives upon my return to Spain thanks to the
            course in Australia?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I will work permanently in the company Best-Marketing located in
            Madrid, work in my father's company making the Website of his
            company and in the company of my sister, legal advice, doing the web
            and App. Another project that I have in mind and is not guaranteed
            is to get into aviation as a programmer, I have 8 years of
            experience in the sector and it has many gaps in modernization, I
            want to make Apps internal and improve the lives of workers (since I
            have been one and I have suffered the delays of non-modernization).

          <h3>Why Australia?</h3>
          <p>
            I have decided to study full stack abroad, as I think it is the best
            way to grow up in your career. I selected Australia because it has
            an education system that has been proven to work for many students.
            Also combines different ecosystems, it has beautiful beaches,
            cosmopolitan cities, deserts, and jungle. The most important reason
            for picking Australia is the safety it offers to all the community
            and the wellness of the students. Last but not least, I have chosen
            Australia because it is an English speaking country and I will be
            able to improve and practice the language all day. This gives me the
            conﬁdence that I will return home with a great English level, which
            will be the key in order to achieve my professional goal. I
            specifically chose Sydney because it is a big city where there are
            several things in common with the place I am living, Madrid, like
            the weather, cultural activities and tourists. Upon my arrival I
            will check the visitor center to check the cultural events and plan
            the ones I want to attend.

            professional development when I get back home. Furthermore, being
            successful at it will help me grow personally. Last but not least,
            Laneway cultural diversity will let me interact with people from
